* Introduction
This is the implemetation of my Machine Learning models that was used in my Scientific Initiation project. To use it, you will need to have the [[https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR024883][Aquasat]] dataset, and the [[https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means?tab=form][ERA5]] reanalysis dataset. For the era Era5 dataset, you will check the following variables:
- 2m_temperature
- Surface net Solar Radiation
- Evaporation from open water surfaces excluding oceans
- 10m_u_component_of_wind
- 10m_v_component_of_wind
- Total precipitation
- Leaf Area Index High vegetation
- Leaf Area Index Low vegetation

* Usage
To use the models, you will need to have the Aquasat dataset and the ERA5 dataset. The libraries that you will need to install are:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib (optional)
- seaborn (optional)
- sklearn
- xarray
- Dask
- optuna
- XGBoost
- sciencePlots (optional)

Then you can follow the steps in the notebooks to train the models.

* Models
The models that are implemented are:
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- SVR

They all are trained in somewhat deterministic ways, so it will be similar with the results that I got in my project.

* Disclaimer
I know that the code is not the best, but I'm still learning. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. I tried my best to make it as clean as possible, but I know that there are some things that I could improve. If you have any questions, please let me know, I will be happy to help you.
